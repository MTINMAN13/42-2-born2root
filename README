     ```
     sudo mysql_secure_installation
     ```
   - Create a new database and user:
     ```
     sudo mysql -u root -p
     CREATE DATABASE yourdb;
     GRANT ALL ON yourdb.* TO 'youruser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

5. **Install and Configure PHP:**
   - Ensure PHP is installed:
