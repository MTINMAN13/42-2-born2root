Setting up a functional WordPress website on your Debian 12 server with lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP, along with an additional service of your choice, can be a comprehensive task. Here's an optimal outline to guide you through the process:

Prepare Your Debian 12 Server:

Ensure that your server is up to date with the latest packages and security patches.
Set up a non-root user with sudo privileges to perform administrative tasks.
Install Required Software:

Install lighttpd (web server), MariaDB (database), and PHP (scripting language).
Use the package manager apt to install these components.
Configure Lighttpd:

Create a virtual host configuration file for your WordPress site in the /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/ directory.
Enable the virtual host by creating a symbolic link in the /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled/ directory.
Configure the virtual host settings for your WordPress site, including the document root.
Install and Configure MariaDB:

Secure the MariaDB installation by running the mysql_secure_installation script.
Create a new database and a dedicated user for your WordPress site.
Grant the necessary privileges to the user on the database.
Install and Configure PHP:

Ensure PHP is installed and configured with the necessary extensions required for WordPress.
Adjust PHP settings to match WordPress's requirements (e.g., memory limit, max execution time).
Install and Set Up WordPress:

Download the latest WordPress release and extract it to the document root specified in your lighttpd configuration.
Create a wp-config.php file and configure it with the database settings you created in MariaDB.
Additional Service Setup:

Choose an additional service you find useful for your WordPress website and install/configure it.
Justify your choice during the defense. Examples include:
Fail2Ban for security
Let's Encrypt for SSL/TLS certificates
WP-CLI for managing WordPress from the command line
Memcached for caching
Configure DNS and Firewall:

Update your DNS records to point to your server's IP address.
Adjust your server's firewall settings to allow traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) if necessary.
Test Your WordPress Website:

Access your website through a web browser to ensure it's functional.
Create a new WordPress admin user and perform basic configuration and customization.
Backup and Monitoring:

Set up regular backups for your WordPress site and databases.
Implement monitoring and alerting for the server and website health.
Documentation and Final Checks:

Document all the configurations and settings made during the setup.
Perform final checks to ensure that everything is working as expected.
Prepare for Defense:

Review your choices for the additional service and be ready to justify them during your defense.
Remember to consult the official documentation for each component you install to ensure you follow best practices and stay up to date with any changes or new features. This outline provides a general roadmap for setting up a WordPress website on Debian 12 with the specified services and an additional service of your choice.
